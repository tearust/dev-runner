## About the directory
This directory is used to store custom wasm actors for test purposes. Note that only the files with the extension "wasm" can be loaded.

The directory contains two subdirectories:
- `a-node`: used to store all custom actors test on A node
- `b-node`: used to store all custom actors test on B node
